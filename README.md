### The Initialization Weights for Training
Download pre-trained classification weights of the [Swin Transformer](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/storage/releases/download/v1.0.0/swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224.pth) , and place the ` .pth ` files in ` ./pretrained_model ` directory. These weights are essential for initializing the model during training.

### Trained Weights of MTPNet for Testing
We provide Trained Weights of our MTPNet.

### Train
Please download the pre-trained model weights and dataset first. Next, generate the path of the training set and the test set, and change the dataset path in the code to the path of the dataset you specified.

~~~python
python train.py
~~~

### Test
Download the MTPNet model weights, create the necessary directories to store these files, and be sure to update the corresponding paths in the code accordingly. 

~~~python

python test.py

~~~

### Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our MTPNet on ORSSDï¼ŒEORSSD and ORSI-4199 datasets.

### Evaluation Tool
You can use the [evaluation tool (MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
